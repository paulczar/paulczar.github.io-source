          <h1>Multiple Processes in Docker with Supervisord</h1>
          <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 22, 2014</span>
          

<p>Almost since <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a> was first introduced to the world there has been a fairly strong push to keeping containers to be single process.   This makes a lot of sense and definitely plays into the <a href="http://12factor.net">12 Factor</a> way of thinking where all application output should be pushed to <code>stdout</code> and docker itself with tools like <a href="https://github.com/progrium/logspout">logspout</a> now has fairly strong tooling to deal with those logs.</p>

<p>Sometimes however it just makes sense to run more than one process in a container,  a perfect example would be running <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd">confd</a> as well as your application in order to modify the application&rsquo;s config file based on changes in service discovery systems like <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a>.   The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/articles/ambassador_pattern_linking/">ambassador</a> container way of working can achieve similar things, but I&rsquo;m not sure that running two containers with a process each to run your application is any better than running one container with two processes.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going run multiple processes you have a few options to do it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the container with the first process adnd then use the new <code>docker exec</code> command to start the second.</li>
<li>Start them in sequence in a <code>bash</code> script and background all but the last process with a <code>&amp;</code> at the end of the line.</li>
<li>Use a Process Supervisor such as Supervisord or Runit.</li>
</ol>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t really messed around with the first option, maybe it could work out, but you&rsquo;d lose the logs from the second process as it would need to output via the first process&rsquo; <code>stdout</code>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">The Bash Script</h2>

<p>Up until recently the way I have been running multiple processes is via the <code>bash</code> script method, but it feels really clumsy and fragile and while it works I&rsquo;ve never been particularly fond of it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an snippet from such a script from my <a href="https://github.com/paulczar/docker-elk_confd">docker-elk_confd</a> project which builds out the [ELK]() stack using values in <code>etcd</code> to orchestrate clustering and configuration via <code>confd</code>.</p>

<pre><code>echo Starting ${APP_NAME}

confd -node $ETCD -config-file /app/confd.toml -confdir /app &amp;
/opt/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch -p /app/elasticsearch.pid &amp;

# while the port is listening, publish to etcd
while [[ ! -z $(netstat -lnt | awk &quot;\$6 == \&quot;LISTEN\&quot; &amp;&amp; \$4 ~ \&quot;.$PUBLISH\&quot; &amp;&amp; \$1 ~ \&quot;$PROTO.?\&quot;&quot;) ]] ; do
  publish_to_etcd
  sleep 5 # sleep for half the TTL
done
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I&rsquo;ve started two processes <code>elasticsearch</code> and <code>confd</code> both backgrounded and then I finish with a loop which publishes data to etcd every 5 seconds until the <code>elasticsearch</code> process quits listening on its published tcp port.  This works, but it leaves me feeling a bit icky.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Process Supervisor</h2>

<p>I have used various supervisors in containers before but never really liked the experience as I could never get all the logs out to <code>stdout</code> and using the standard docker logging mechanisms so I&rsquo;ve always gone back to the <code>bash</code> script method.  Recently while working on the ELK project mentioned above I decided to give using a process supervisor another chance.</p>

<p>My primary measure of success for using a supervisor going forward was to come up with a way to push all output to the supervisor&rsquo;s stdout so that I can use the regular docker logging.</p>

<p>I decided to try with <a href="http://supervisord.org">supervisor</a> as a starting point because it is a fairly small install and has an easily templatable config.   At about the same time I was looking at this I found a <a href="http://supervisord.org">blog post</a> ( I believe it was linked in a recent Docker Weekly ) that talked about using <code>supervisor</code> in docker containers.  They had even (sortof) solved the logging problem,  however the logging was appended with debug lines and made it messy and difficult to read.  I figured there had to be a cleaner way.</p>

<p>Reading through the documentation I saw that you can specify a file to log each supervised process to.   I just needed a way to hijack that config item to write to supervisor&rsquo;s stdout instead.   Turns out that&rsquo;s quite easy as there&rsquo;s a special device <code>/dev/stdout</code> which links to <code>/dev/self/fd/1</code> which is the <code>stdout</code> for the running application.   I quickly threw together a test and it did indeed pipe the logs from the process through <code>stdout</code> of supervisor.</p>

<p>I end up with a <code>/etc/supervisord.conf</code> ( which is written out by confd before supervisor is started ) file that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[supervisord]
logfile=/dev/null
pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid
nodaemon=true

[program:publish_etcd]
command=/app/bin/publish_etcd
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
auto_start=true
autorestart=true

[program:confd]
command=confd -node %(ENV_ETCD)s -config-file /app/confd.toml -confdir /app
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
auto_start=true
autorestart=true

[program:elasticsearch]
command=/opt/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
auto_start=true
autorestart=true
</code></pre>

<p>and my boot script that docker runs the following to launch my app:</p>

<pre><code>echo Starting ${APP_NAME}
/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf
</code></pre>

<p>All output from <code>Elasticsearch</code>, <code>confd</code>, <code>supervisord</code> now output via the docker logging systems so that I can see what is going on by running:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker logs elasticsearch
docker logs -f 7270755ce94c03dda930fbdedeee7722dddf6fdbbf8902aaee52c9f94f2147ca

</code></pre>

<p>One last thing that I should mention.  the <code>publish_etcd</code> talk in the supervisor config is running a script that contains the <code>while</code> loop to make sure that <code>elasticsearch</code> is listening on the approriate port, If that loop is broken it means that<code>elasticsearch</code> is not responding and it sends a kill signal to <code>supervisor</code> which then causes the container to shoot itself in the head because the rest of the  processes running are useless without <code>elasticsearch</code> running.</p>
